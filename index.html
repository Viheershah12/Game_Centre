        <p class="desc">Gaming in kenya has evolved vastly over the years. Whether it is Grand theft auto
          of the famous Call of duty. From low spec games like GTA Vice City and GTA Liberty City to
          having
          the capicity to play high spec games like GTA V and Call Of Duty Mordern Warfare. Kenya has also
          managed to increase the accesibility to other platforms like Playstation and X-box and ofcourse
          improving in the IT sector until the extent to hosting gaming houses where kids can go there to
          play
          and compete with other kids at the arena and building relationships using games.</p>

        <p class="desc">Over the year there have been several stores that have set up in kenya,
          particullarly
          in the big cities like Nairobi and Mombasa. In these stores there are several different types of
          platforms
          from Playstation to X-box and PSP to nintendo at very good and resonable prices. There are also
          PCs that
          are very high spec that enable the games to run very smoothly and also sell very high end games
          for all the
          platforms that are available in the market. Every year there has been new platforms coming into
          the
          country as well as compatible games into the respective stores. The stores also sell graphics
          cards so if
          you PC isnt able to run the game nothing to worry about as they could be easily upgraded to make
          it able to
          run the games very comfortably

        <h1 class="title">Gaming Centres</h1>
        <p class="desc">Gaming centres are stations where kids can go there and play playstation and other
          platforms
          for a very good and cheap price, here kids and compete with each other setting and creating new
          records that
          have to be beaten. On beating a certain record a reward may be earned. Gaming centres usually
          are located in malls
          or complexes and they tend to be huge in size such that they can accomodate several kids in one
          centre making it a very
          good place for kids to spend their day. In kenya parents leave their kids at these centres and
          go spend quality time
          this is proven the be highly safe as there are caretakers/babysitters that would take complete
          care of the children and
          are fully held responsible for any mishap. Over the years these centres have improved
          significantly by staying up to date
          with the technology and and hardware as well as offering numerous number of games ranging for
          kids of the age 7-20 years old.
          These centres also hold private parties and PS nights to offer both teens and adults a very good
          an new gaming expereince in
          kenya.

        <h1 class="title">What the future holds...</h1>
        <p class="desc">In the bright future Kenya should be able to actually host worldwide competitions
          and give life changing
          rewards that would change kenya and introduce them to the gaming world hence rewarding them for
          their amazing talent in
          gaming even though they are not financially stable. This in the long run would reduce the
          poverty and change the mindset
          of people when it comes to gaming.This would help the students who may not be very interested in
          studies that would make them
          interested into the gaming industry.
